# Creator Stats App - Documentation 🎉

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is being hosted [here, on prdx.cloud](https://prdx.cloud).

## Getting Started 🤔

- Setup Git on your computer, SSH Keys, etc.
- Clone this repo to where you want using SSH like:

`git clone git@github.com:LabsParadox/Demo.git`

- Open your terminal and use the `CD` command to navigate to the project
- Run the command `npm install` to install all neccesary packages.

## Commands to Know 💿

### 🛠️ `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### 📦 `npm run deploy`

Automatically builds the project and minifies it. The built project is pushed to the `gh-pages` branch and deployed immedietly and automatically.

### 🚨 `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
